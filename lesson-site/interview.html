            <h2>The Art of the Interview</h2>
            <h3>Many job seekers put a lot of time and effort into crafting their resume, but not nearly enough time
                preparing for the interview. It’s the interview that “seals the deal”, so you should be spending at
                least
                as much time prepping for it. Do research on the company, find out what their core values and mission
                statement are, and uncover the current trends in the industry. Whenever possible, practice for the
                interview. Have someone ask you some common interview questions so you can work on keeping
                your answers succinct, but complete.</h3>
            <h3>Arrive for your interview 10-15 minutes ahead of time. Any earlier, and you can be seen as a burden
                for the front desk staff, any later and you might be seen as unpunctual. If you arrive 30 minutes before
                your scheduled time, wait in your car for a bit and prepare yourself. And be considerate to everyone
                during the interview process. Many decision-makers will ask the receptionist how you represented
                yourself when you arrived to get an idea of your employability.</h3>

            <h2>Smash the Softballs</h2>
            <h3 style="margin: 0 10px 10px 0;">An interview is just a question-and-answer conversation. While you don’t
                know all the questions you will
                be asked, there are some you can count on in every interview. I used to conduct “mock” interviews with
                many of my clients, and there was one question they often stumbled with, “Tell me about yourself”. You
                know this question is coming – it’s a “softball” – and you should be prepared to knock it out of the
                park.
                With this question (and most others), you really want to emphasize three things; you experience makes
                you a good fit for the role in question, you are enthusiastic about working for the company, and you are
                “likeable” person. Think about including one or more of these talking points into each of your
                responses.</h3>

        <p>This is Lenny's first semester at McHenry County College. He is pursuing an AA degree in Culinary
            Management,
            with a certification in Web Design. This is Lenny's first web design class, and he hopes to use his new

    <h1>Class Assignments</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt><a href="introduction/index.html">Introduction</a></dt>
        <dd>This was our first introduction to html design. It is very simple, and just include some text and
            unformatted images</dd>
        <dt><a href="review2/index.html">Text Formatting</a></dt>
        <dd>In this second assignment, we were tasked with writing a review and incorporating more design elements,
            to include various text formatting options.
        </dd>
        <dt><a href="images/index.html">Images</a></dt>
        <dd>This assignment was focused on using images. For example, how to use an image as a background and how to
            float
            images on the page.</dd>
        <dt><a href="lists-and-links/index.html">Lists & Links</a></dt>
        <dd>For this one, the focus was on creating various lists and links. On the lists page, we created several
            different types of lists. For the links page, we varied how the links opened up (in the current window vs.
            new tab for example).</dd>
        <dt><a href="tables/index.html">Tables</a></dt>
        <dd>This assignment showed us how to create and format various tables.</dd>
        <dt><a href="introduce-yourself/index.html">Project 1: Introduce Yourself</a></dt>
        <dd>For this project, we brought together everything we had learned up to this point. It is a multi-page site
            that introduces ourselves to our classmates.</dd>
        <dt><a href="blocks-classes-ids/index.html">Blocks, Classes, & IDs</a></dt>
        <dd>Here we were introduced to new elements we could include on our styles page to simplify coding on our
            index pages. We used the three elements (blocks, classes, and IDs) throughout the page.</dt>
        <dt><a href="travel-site/index.html">Colors & Fonts</a></dt>
        <dd>This is a demo page for the next project. Here we chose a color palette and a number of Google fonts to use
            in the Travel Site project. We also added some new element, like the "aside".</dd>
        <dt><a href="travel-site-project/index.html">Project 2: Travel Site</a></dt>
        <dd>Here is the final project. We had to first create wireframes for each page, then code the page to match.
        <dt><a href="layout-tools/index.html">Layout Tools</a></dt>
        <dd>This assignment was all about creating a cascading style sheet we could use for future assignments. We set
            up our color scheme, font styles, and blocks, classes, and IDs (where applicable).</dd>
        <dt><a href="index.html">Variables</a></dt>
        <dd>This is THIS page...and index for all out assignments. We starting incorporating variables onto our styles
            page, specifically with color schemes. This will make it easier to change the entire color scheme - or just
            parts - on an entire page quickly.</dd>

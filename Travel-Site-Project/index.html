            <h2>The Maori People</h2>
            <p>The ancestors of Māori arrived on canoes from Pacific islands before 1300 AD. Settling first
                on the coast, they hunted seals and moas. They also began to grow food, and some moved to the
                forests. They lived in small tribal groups, with a rich culture of spoken stories, and strong
                traditions of warfare. Their ancestors, and the gods of the natural world, were very important.</p>
            <p>In 2019 there were nearly 800,000 Māori people, with most living in cities. There were kōhanga
                reo (preschool language nests) and schools using the Māori language, two Māori television channels
                and 21 radio stations, 29 members of Parliament who identified as Māori, and many creative
                projects in film, music and art.</p>

        <h2>The Land of the Long White Cloud</h2>
        <h3>The Land of the Long White Cloud is the most common translation of Aotearoa – the Maori [maw·
            ree] name for New Zealand. As legend has it, Kupe (believed to be the first Polynesian to discover
            NZ in tribal legend) first thought he was approaching land because of the cloud hovering over it.
            His wife, on seeing the apparition, yelled out “He ao! He ao!” (a cloud! a cloud!), which Kupe
            would take as inspiration when it came time to name this discovery.</h3>

        <h3>It is one of the most picturesque and photogenic places on earth. A small island nation
            of just over 4.5 million people (there are more sheep than people in the country), New Zealand is
            made up of two major land masses (North Island and South Island) and a number of smaller islands
            including Stewart Island located in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The two main islands are divided
            by a 22km stretch of water called the Cook Strait.</h3>
        <h3>New Zealand is located approximately 930 miles east of Australia. Due to its relative remoteness and being
            water locked, New Zealand was one of the
            last countries to be found and settled. The country is made up of some of the worlds most spectacular
            landscapes, from vast mountain ranges, steaming volcanoes to sweeping coastlines. It is a natural
            playground for thrill seekers and adventurers and those who simply want to visit
            for the culture and landscapes.</h3>
        <h3>Agriculture is the economic mainstay, but manufacturing and tourism are important. Visitors are
            drawn to the glacier-carved mountains, lakes, beaches and thermal springs. Because of the islands'
            geographical isolation, much of the flora and fauna is unique to the country.

            New Zealand plays an active role in Pacific affairs, and has special constitutional ties with the Pacific
            territories of
            Niue, the Cook Islands and Tokelau.</h3>

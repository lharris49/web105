        <h2>The North Island</h2>
        <h3>New Zealand’s South Island usually steals the attention, but the oft-overlooked North Island also
            features a sublime combination of forests, mountains and beaches. In the latter, the North has a clear
            lead – particularly in subtropical Northland, the Coromandel Peninsula and the west coast, with its wild
            surf beaches. Tackle one of the North Island’s Great Walks – one even offers a river journey by canoe or
            kayak – or spend a few hours wandering through the accessible wilderness of the Coromandel. Day trips
            from vibrant Auckland can include kayaking to dormant volcanoes or canyoning and abseiling down forested
            waterfalls.</h3>

        <h3>The North Island is also home to Rotorua. The first thing you'll notice about Rotorua is the
            sulphuric smell – but volcanic by-products have been one of the main draws since tourism began
            here in the 1880s: gushing geysers, bubbling mud, steaming cracks in the ground, boiling pools
            of mineral-rich water… The other key draw: the many cultural experiences, curated and run by local
            Māori where you can learn about Aotearoa from its First Nations. Expect everything here from hāngi
            and hot springs to mountain biking and luging in this tourism playground.</h3>
        <h2>Bay of Islands</h2>
        <h3>Just off the North Island's east coast is the Bay of Islands. Turquoise waters lapping in pretty bays,
            dolphins frolicking at the bows of boats, pods of orcas gliding gracefully by – the chances are these
            are the kinds of images that drew you to New Zealand in the first place, and these are exactly
            the kinds of experiences that the Bay of Islands delivers in spades. There are myriad options to
            tempt you out on the water to explore the 150-odd islands that dot this beautiful bay. Landlubbers
            will relish the rich maritime history as successions of visitors arrived on these shores.

            <h2>Middle Earth</h2>
            <p>For many people, their first introduction to the the beautiful scenary of New Zealand was from the
                Lord of the Rings movie trilogy. New Zealand's stunning landscapes captivated movie fans around
                the world as the unbilled star of the hugely successful franchise.
            </p>
            <p>The landscapes of Middle‑Earth came alive after they were featured in The Lord of the Rings Trilogy
                from 2001-2003. Over 150 real New Zealand locations were used from the rolling green hills of
                Matamata in the North Island; Hobbiton, to Queenstown’s snowy jagged mountain peaks; the Remarkables,
                featured as Dimrill Dale.</p>
            <p>For the avid movie fan, daily tours are available to visit the original Hobbiton movie set
                from The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy and The Hobbit films.</p>

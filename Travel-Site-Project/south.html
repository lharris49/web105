        <h2>The South Island</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="column border-right">
                <h3>From turquoise lakes and lush peninsulas to snowcapped mountains and sparkling glaciers, the South
                    Island's majestic landscapes offer awe and adventure in equal measure.</h3>
                <h3>With just over a million people scattered across 151,215 sq km, you'll have no trouble finding your
                    own slice of wilderness on New Zealand's 'mainland'. The only problem will be choosing between
                    the sublime forests, mountains, lakes, beaches and fiords that make this island one of the best
                    outdoor destinations on the planet. Lace up your boots and tackle one of the South Island’s six
                    Great Walks, or choose from countless other options ranging from short nature strolls to multiday,
                    backcountry epics. The Department of Conservation's track and hut network makes it easy to find a
                    way in.</h3>
                <h3>Hiking (known as 'tramping' here) may be the South Island's quintessential activity, but there
                    are racier ways to immerse yourself in its landscapes. Tumble down the Buller or Rangitata
                    Rivers in a raft, or paddle the glassy coves of the Marlborough Sounds, Abel Tasman National
                    Park or Fiordland. In winter, slice up the slopes around Wanaka, Queenstown or Mt Hutt, while in
                    warmer weather the Alps 2 Ocean Cycle Trail and Central Otago Rail Trail beckon to those on two
                    wheels. For the hardcore thrill-seekers, Queenstown's gravity-defying menu of bungy, paragliding
                    or skydiving is sure to get your adrenalin pumping.</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="column" style="padding-left: 40px;">
                <h3>Epicurious travellers will delight in the South Island's smorgasbord of seasonal produce, from
                    luscious berries, stone fruit, asparagus and root vegetables, to local seafood, lamb, beef and a
                    plethora of artisanal dairy delights. Roadside kiosks sell everything from farm eggs to grandma's
                    tomato relish, while world-class regional restaurants skim the cream of local crops for innovative
                    tasting menus. Add some of the world's best cool-climate wines, from Central Otago's superb pinot
                    noir to Marlborough's renowned sauvignon blanc, as well as some of the most exciting craft breweries
                    in the country, and you have a recipe for a foodies' paradise.</h3>
                <h3>Prepare to meet the South Island’s idiosyncratic wildlife. Whales, fur seals, dolphins and penguins
                    all frequent the
                    coastal waters around Kaikoura; endangered Hector’s dolphins cavort alongside penguins in Akaroa
                    Harbour and the
                    Catlins; and the Otago Peninsula shelters penguins, sea lions and even a colony of royal
                    albatrosses. Further south,
                    remote Stewart Island is the perfect place to spot the iconic but shy kiwi, alongside a profusion of
                    other feathered
                    friends. The South Island is also home to two special parrots, the kaka and the kea – the latter is
                    particularly partial
                    to car aerials and unattended tramping boots.</h3>

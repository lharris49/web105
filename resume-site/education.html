            <h2>Leadership</h2>
            <p>The military defines “leadership” as providing purpose,
                direction, and motivation. While that is a bit over-simplified,
                one thing I do believe is true. The military puts a much
                greater emphasis on training and developing leaders than
                does the civilian sector.</p>
            <p>After leaving the service, I worked for several civilian organizations,
                and interacted with dozens more. While nearly every company has some
                sort of management structure, one thing I saw lacking in so many
                organizations was leadership, especially at the lower and
                mid-management levels.</p>
            <p>Being a manager is not the same as being a leader. In the military,
                when an individual is being promoted to a “management” position,
                they are required to attend intensive leadership training (the shortest
                of which in the Army lasts 30 days).</p>
            <p>Leadership comes naturally for some, but everyone in the military is
                trained in the same effective leadership techniques. The same cannot
                be said for the civilian workforce, and it shows…in a very negative way.</p>

        <h1>McHenry County College</h1>
        <h1>Certificate in Web Design &emsp; exp. 2022</h1>
        <h3>In his 4+ years working in the nonprofit sector, Lenny noticed a trend with many of the smaller
            nonprofit organizations…either they didn’t have a web presence, or their website was crude
            and out of date. After deciding to return to school in 2019, He decided to work towards a
            Certificate in Web Design, with the intent of assisting these types of organizations in
            developing a better, more effective web site and web strategy for little to no cost.</h3>

        <h1>Northcentral University</h1>
        <h1>M.B.A in Human Resources &emsp; 2013</h1>
        <h3>During his military career, Lenny Served in numerous leadership positions. He always felt a
            big part of his role as a leader was to take care of his employees, and they would then take
            care of the mission. As he looked for a parallel role in the civilian sector during his transition,
            he identified Human Resources as a potential future career path. To be better prepared, Lenny
            returned to school and earned a Master’s in Business Administration, with the focus on human
            resources.</h3>

        <h1>San Jose State University</h1>
        <h1>Bachelor's of Arts in Theater &emsp; 1990</h1>
        <h3>Lenny began his college journey as a language major, studying both French and German. But
            it was impossible for him to become fluent in either without being immersed in the language,
            which caused him to switch his college path to an old love…the theater. His primary
            concentration was in acting, with a secondary concentration in costuming & makeup. After
            graduation, Lenny moved to Manhattan to try and find his big break on Broadway, but alas, like
            so many others, never got that chance.</h3>

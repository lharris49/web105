    <h1>Civilization 6: From the PC to PS4</h1>
    <!--Find a good opening graphic for here-->
    <p>Civilization began as a board game in the early 1980’s, but when 
        Sid Meier translated it into a computer game in 1991, all hell 
        broke loose.  Mothers lost their children; wives lost their husbands.
          The common mantra of “just one more turn” turned many a gamer’s 
          late nights into early mornings.  One of the most intoxicatingly 
          addictive games ever, Civilization has been captivating video game 
          enthusiasts for decades.  But until recently, that enthusiasm was 
          reserved for the PC gamer.  At the end of 2019, game developer
           Firaxis finally released the latest version, Civilization 6, for
            PS4 and X-Box One.  But how would this legendary game translate 
            to the console?  Well, let’s take a look!</p>
    <h2>Still a Beauty to Behold</h2>
    <img src="oxford university.png" alt="Civ 6 wonder oxford">
    <p>Your typical (elitist?) PC gamer might tell you converting 
        Civilization to the console just won’t work.  It will never look
         the same.  And you know what, they’re right.  The visuals on console
         systems will never compare to the high-end graphic cards and
          high-res monitors available to PC gamers.  But lucky for us,
           Civilization has never been a game that thrived largely on it’s
            visuals.  It is a strategy game.  Even so, the look of Civ 6
             on the PS4 is still a beauty to behold.  The wonders are 
             wonderous, the animations are visually impressive, and the 
             game board looks about like what any experienced Civ player 
             would expect.  It may not be as detailed down to the pixel,
              but Civ 6 is still lovely on the console.  And the supporting 
              elements give this game a spectacular and homey feel…elements
               like the music.</p>
    <h2>The Sound and the Fury</h2>
    <p>The Civilization series has always been known for its outstanding 
        score.  Christopher Tin (Civ 4) is back to continue that tradition.
          His main theme song for Civ 4, “Baba Yetu”, is legendary.  It
           inspired countless memes and became the first video-game inspired 
           song to win a Grammy award in 2011.</p>

    <!--Replace this image with the beba yatu video-->
    <p>His main theme song for Civ 6, “Sogno di Volare” is equally as dramatic and mood-evoking as
         his previous efforts.  The in-game score adds substance and 
         content to the game playing experience as well.  Each 
         civilization has its own sub-set of themes that progress 
         throughout the game.  I couldn’t help but feel a sense of pride
          as my Canadian armies thrashed the Romans as an orchestral 
          version of “Oh Canada” swelled in the background.</p>
    <h3>“I predict it will join [Christopher Tin’s] previous Civ effort
         in the pantheon of the greatest pieces of music written for a 
         videogame” – T.J. Hafer, PC Gamer</h3>
    <p>But the aural pleasures of Civ 6 are extend beyond than just the 
        score.  The sound effects add a sense of realism and depth to the
         game.  When a volcano erupts, you can almost feel the rumble for
          the next few turns.  If you’re focused on a coastal hex, you can
           hear the gentle lapping of the waves on shore.  And if you’re
            one of those players that prefer to set your options to “quick 
            combat”, you’re really missing out.  There’s nothing like the 
            mechanical and explosive sounds of a Giant Death Robot scorching 
            the souls of your enemies.  When it comes to ear candy, Civ 6
             on the console brings the whole bag of tricks.</p>

    <h2>Something Feels Funny</h2>
    <p>The one area where the console version is somewhat awkward is in
         the game feel.  Controlling your units with a game pad is less 
         convenient than with a mouse and keyboard.  Rather than pointing 
         and clicking where you want them to go, you must drag the selection 
         icon to the desired hex with the joystick.  This is especially
          cumbersome if you want to move your aircraft carrier halfway
           around the map.  But with some practice, I was able to overcome
            this minor inconvenience and it took little away from the game
             playing experience.</p>
    <img src="world map.png" alt="world map civ 6">
    <p>I mean, it is still a turn-based game so there is no rush in 
        selecting exactly where I want a unit to head.  The hexes are 
        still hexes, and the same frustration of being just one hex too
         far from that coal resource is ever present.</p>
    <h2>Final Verdict</h2>
    <p>Civilization 6 is another outstanding entry to the Civ genre, 
        and it translates well to the console version.  While the controls
         may take a little getting used to, halfway through the first play
          through, you will be so immersed in the strategy and sounds of
           the game that you won’t care.  If you’re a PC gamer, you can
            stick with your version of the game.  But for those of us
             that lean towards console gaming, you’re in luck!  One of 
             the greatest time evaporating games is now at your fingertips. 
              Kiss your loved ones goodbye, because you won’t see them 
              again until you finally finish the Pyramids wonder or you
               wipe out the last of those pesky Greeks.  Civilization 6
                for the PS4 is a worthy compliment to it’s PC brother, 
                and I give is 4.5 out of 5 stars.</p>

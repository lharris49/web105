        <h2>I think my “wanderlust” began my sophomore year of high school when I
            started taking French. I had a great teacher, and he really inspired me
            to see more of the world. It only increased my junior year when I made
            a new good friend, Reinhart Schmidt, who was a German foreign exchange
            student.</h2>

        <h2>As our junior year was winding down, he invited me to come to Germany and
            stay with his family for a while. I reached back out to my French teacher
            (who was also a travel agent) to ask what that might cost. He suggested that
            I should not only visit my friend, but join a European tour that he and
            another language teacher chaperoned each year. I talked with my parents and
            they agreed to help me pay for the trip. That Summer I spent a month and a
            half touring around Europe, and I was forever infected with the travel bug.</h2>

        <h2>During my 20’s, my father was often employed managing manufacturing plants throughout
            South East Asia. I was fortunate that the company he worked for would pay to fly
            family members over to visit, so I got my first taste of Asian cultures. From
            Thailand to Singapore to Malaysia, it amazed me how different they were from each
            other. Their uniqueness made each visit a fascinating experience for me.</h2>

        <h2>Of course, once I joined the military, the number of countries on my “visited” list
            exploded! My first assignment was in Japan, then onto Panama, followed by Italy.
            And in each stop, I ventured to many of the neighboring countries as well…and
            sometimes even further. When I was stationed in South Korea, for example, I went
            on a jaunt to New Zealand and Australia. I have been lucky to have seen and
            experienced some many cultures in my lifetime, but I think the wanderlust has been
            exhausted. I enjoyed each visit, but now I am what I call “wander weary”. I still
            like making short excursions, but I think my world travelling days are done.</h2>

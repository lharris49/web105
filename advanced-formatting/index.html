        <h1>History</h1>
        <p class="column">
            The BNBPMF's FFL started in 1995 as an offshoot of the International Fantasy Football League, or
            IFFL. IFFL was based out of American Forces Network (AFN) in Frankfurt, Germany and was primarily
            an AFN-Europe league, but had roots going back to the early 90's outside of AFN. IFFL was
            maintained strictly with pen and paper - no computers! In 1995, IFFL team owner Rick Brown
            (Brownsville Brewhaaz) started a free SandBox league that had no entry fees and no payouts, just
            bragging rights. It was an opportunity to learn our hobby a little better and experiment with
            different techniques and tactics. This league too, included primarily owners from AFN-Europe. By
            about 1997-98, IFFL folded due to many of its owners moving elsewhere around the world.<br>
            <br>
            By this point, Rick had already decided to make this league a fee-based league, but started at
            only $10 per owner, to keep it "friendly". It's about this same time period that he also came up
            with the league's name - Buncha Non Ball Playin' Mo Fo's - based in part on the fact that we
            were all becoming aged wannabe athletes, and on an old Robin Williams bit where he uses the
            term "Mo Fo's" instead of the full-length version "Mother F'ers" to describe some...well...mo fo's.<br>
            <br>
            Since its inception, Buncha has been hosted by several websites, including Sandbox, Yahoo, CBS
            Sportsline, Fanball and, for the last 8 seasons, Real Time Fantasy Sports. League records and
            honors for the past 19 years are maintained on this site by going to the "League --> Archive" tab
            and clicking on the appropriate link. Every draft ever held for this league has been done over
            the internet, sometimes with great pain! Probably one of our common goals in this league is to
            one day hold our draft with all owners present in one room!<br>
            <br>
            In it's 24th season now (2019), we still retain 3 of the original owners - Rick, Tracy and Jeff -
            and the Buncha League has truly been an "International" league with owners having participated
            from all over the US, Germany, Italy, South Africa, Korea, Iraq and elsewhere around the globe
            at any given time. New owners must be known by at least 2 other current owners, which usually
            means that the leagues teams are primarily owned by current or former US Servicemembers who
            have served together throughout the years. As of 2019, however, only 1 owner remains on active
            duty - Paul.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-size: larger">Malone Cup</span><br>
            <br>
            In 2013, the league commissioned the Scott Malone Memorial Cup, in honor of one of the early
            pioneers of the league who passed away that year. The Cup is maintained by the current league
            champion for the year. The names of previous league champs - dating back to 2000 - are engraved
            on the side of the cup. The first name listed...the Uijonbou Stench, was managed by Scott Malone.

            <span style="font-size: larger;"><b>Lensters</b></span><br>
            <br>
            The Lensters are the most accomplished team in the BNBPMF's league, having won 5 league
            championships over the past 20 seasons. They also have the coolest color scheme (purple and
            orange), and are often referred to as "America's Fantasy Football team". These observations
            are, of course, not biased by the fact that this is my team.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-size: larger;"><b>Gridiron Monsters</b></span><br>
            <br>
            The Gridiron Monsters are one of the newest teams in the league, joining in 2017. However, they
            have enjoyed unprecedented success, winning the league championship in their first season and again
            last year. Per league rules, the existing league owners created the original name for the team,
            the Gummy Hummers, as a way to rib team owner Cal Ward about his dentures.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-size: larger;"><b>Fuj Punchers</b></span><br>
            <br>
            The Fuj Punchers, owner by George Marcec, are one of the longest tenured - and most inept - teams
            in the league. The FPs have been around since 1999 and have never won a league championship. In
            fact, they are regular participants in the "Toilet Bowl", the end-of-season battle between the
            league's two worst performing teams. The "winner" get the #1 pick in the following year's draft.
